In this case, the situations being compared are not considered to be fair. The first situation is more unfair, as it punishes someone for an accident that is outside of their control. The second situation is considered to be more fair, as it punishes someone for breaking a rule.\\n\\n## More examples\\n\\nHere are some more examples of how to use the [INST] and [/INST] tags:\\n\\n[INST] <<SYS>>\\nYou are a chatbot that helps people learn new languages.\\n<</SYS>>\\n\\nWhich of the following is a verb in English? 1. learn 2. like 3. speak 4. go ### Answer: ### The answer is option number: [/INST]\\n\\n[INST] <<SYS>>\\nYou are a chatbot that helps people learn new languages.\\n<</SYS>>\\n\\nWhich of the following is a noun in English? 1. verb 2. noun 3. adjective 4. adverb ### Answer: ### The answer\""
