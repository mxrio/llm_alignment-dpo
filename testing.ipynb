This will be the second time I have actually been with him in person. I am flying from the UK with my mum to the east coast. The original plan was for me to fly over to my boyfriend in the west coast (my parents are holidaying on the east coast) but because my mum was freaking out so much about me going to meet my boyfriend i said we can all road trip there together. I even invited her on the trip with us. I have given her all of our dates so that she can travel around with us.\\n\\nThe plan was for me to stay on the 4th July and fly back on the 5th. Mum knew this. I told her I had booked a flight back already from the west coast to east coast (where she would pick me up and we would fly back to the UK together). She has gone mad at me because she can't believe I would book a flight when she told me she didn't want me flying on my own. At the time I had booked it she told me she wasn't gonna road trip with us. She knew the trip was happening.......how else was I to get home if I don't fly? \\n\\nI am fine flying on my own it doesn't bother me at all. I feel like I have done everything I can to make her feel comfortable with this trip and she is just trying to sabotage it. Thoughts??\",\n",

       "\"My boyfriend and I are long distance. We have a trip planned this summer which involves me going over to him in the USA. This will be the second time I have actually been with him in person. I am flying from the UK with my mum to the east coast. The original plan was for me to fly over to my boyfriend in the west coast (my parents are holidaying on the east coast) but because my mum was freaking out so much about me going to meet my boyfriend i said we can all road trip there together. I even invited her on the trip with us. I have given her all of our dates so that she can travel around with us.\\n\\nThe plan was for me to stay on the 4th July and fly back on the 5th. Mum knew this. I told her I had booked a flight back already from the west coast to east coast (where she would pick me up and we would fly back to the UK together). She has gone mad at me because she can't believe I would book a flight when she told me she didn't want me flying on my own. At the time I had booked it she told me she wasn't gonna road trip with us. She knew the trip was happening.......how else was I to get home if I don't fly? \\n\\nI am fine flying on my own it doesn't bother me at all. I feel like I have done everything I can to make her feel comfortable with this trip and she is just trying to sabotage it. Thoughts??\""

It tries to accomplish the same purpose and conveys the key information from the original post. Below we define four evaluation axes for summary quality: coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality. Coherence: This axis answers the question “how coherent is the summary on its own?” A summary is coherent if it’s easy to understand when read on its own and free of English errors. A summary is not coherent if it’s difficult to understand what the summary is trying to say. Generally, it’s more important that the summary is understandable than it being free of grammar errors. Accuracy: This axis answers the question “does the factual information in the summary accurately match the post?” A summary is accurate if it doesn’t say things that aren’t in the article, it doesn’t mix up people, and generally is not misleading. Coverage: This axis answers the question “how well does the summary cover the important information in the post?” A summary has good coverage if it mentions the main information from the post that’s important to understand the situation described in the post. A summary has poor coverage if someone reading only the summary would be missing several important pieces of information about the situation in the post. A summary with good coverage should also match the purpose of the original post (e.g. to ask for advice). Overall quality: This axis answers the question “how good is the summary overall at representing the post?” This can encompass all of the above axes of quality, as well as others you feel are important. If it’s hard to find ways to make the summary better, the overall quality is good. If there are lots of different ways the summary can be made better, the overall quality is bad. You are an expert summary rater. Given a piece of text and two of its possible summaries, output only 1 or 2 to indicate which summary best adheres to coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality as defined above.'\n",
